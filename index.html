        This website is <a href="
      https://en.dict.naver.com/#/entry/enko/ee84d80772d5469f924c8376060a3696
      ">nothing</a>, and it was made just to test.
        To tell you why this site is in English,
        it looks like something is there.
        This is something that everyone will admit.
        And I am good at HTML - The Hyper Text Markup Language.
        The hyperlink on this page is mint because I like mint.
        Loving mint is a matter of course for a human being.
        It is a right and an obligation.
        The reason I say such nonsense is because I have to test
        when I have a lot of literary and long writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we should create a new paragraph at this point.
        This is the second paragraph and I have no intention of translating into English.
        Because it is annoying.
        Actually, there is a more important reason than that,
        which is that I will go to the academy soon.
        I go to academy except two days a week
        because I am on vacation now.
        Is this a human life?
        I hope you check your mailbox carefully
        because the complaint will fly away soon.
        Su-Sik, president of the academy.

        The longer the writing, the more it seems.
        Just in case no one reads this whole thing,
        so I'll just write whatever I want. Now,
        I will color the letters and apply the latest technology
        called "media query," so please look forward to it.
